# MATLAB_Abaqus
These MATLAB codes are used for the pre-processing and post-processing of engineering numerical simulation in the finite element method software Abaqus. 
1. main_frame_2blocks.m is used for pre-processing. It can generate the finite element model in any dimension automatically.
2. no_triangle.m is a function to generate the cohesive elements between the sub-blocks.
3. analysis_4crack_results.m is used for the post-processing. It can acquire the data from the results file and plot the fracture pressure and width automatically.
